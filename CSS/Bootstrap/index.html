                    Data Compass is an assessment platform where hiring managers can know the Programming IQ of their 
                    developer candidates. Data Compass outperforms the market by achieving concurrent criterion validation 
                    for its Programming IQ assessment. In psychometrics, concurrent criterion validation refers to a 
                    comparison between the measure in question and an outcome assessed at the same time. Data Compass 
                    completed its concurrent criterion validation study in March 2019.
