Problem:
Fatal error: Uncaught mysqli_sql_exception: Unknown database '1231' in C:\xampp\htdocs\Village88\PHP with MySQL\connect.php:10 Stack trace: #0 C:\xampp\htdocs\Village88\PHP with MySQL\connect.php(10): mysqli->__construct('localhost', 'root', 'password', '1231') #1 {main} thrown in C:\xampp\htdocs\Village88\PHP with MySQL\connect.php on line 10

Authorization Problem:
Fatal error: Uncaught mysqli_sql_exception: Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO) in C:\xampp\htdocs\Village88\PHP with MySQL\connect.php:10 Stack trace: #0 C:\xampp\htdocs\Village88\PHP with MySQL\connect.php(10): mysqli->__construct('localhost', 'root', '', '1231') #1 {main} thrown in C:\xampp\htdocs\Village88\PHP with MySQL\connect.php on line 10

Solution:
Password is set in user "root" at localhost, connecting to host without a password input can cause error. To fix this, need to provide a password and keep the password in mind. Same as with wrong password input.

Network Problem:
Warning: mysqli::__construct(): php_network_getaddresses: getaddrinfo for localhost1 failed: No such host is known. in C:\xampp\htdocs\Village88\PHP with MySQL\connect.php on line 10

Fatal error: Uncaught mysqli_sql_exception: php_network_getaddresses: getaddrinfo for localhost1 failed: No such host is known. in C:\xampp\htdocs\Village88\PHP with MySQL\connect.php:10 Stack trace: #0 C:\xampp\htdocs\Village88\PHP with MySQL\connect.php(10): mysqli->__construct('localhost1', 'root', 'password', '1231') #1 {main} thrown in C:\xampp\htdocs\Village88\PHP with MySQL\connect.php on line 10

Solution:
"localhost1", no such host is known. Meaning in MySQL there's no "localhost1" user created. To fix this, make sure to know the user details in PHPMyAdmin.
